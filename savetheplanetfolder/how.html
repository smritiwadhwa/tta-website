      <h1 class="why">While we, as children, are not experts on the subject, we do take pride in being able to spread reliable information about ways to help. This video is informative on the general course of action that could fix the mistakes the Industrial Revolution caused. </h1>

      <h1> All of this may seem very stressful. After all, as children, how can WE actually help? Here are some ways your small actions can add up to a big difference!</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><h1>Start off with taking shorter showers. Whether you cut down 5 minutes, 10 minutes, or even 30, we can save 2.5 GALLONS of water <i> each minute! </i></h1></li>
        <li><h1>Just like the girl in this picture, take up gardening or planting as a fun hobby. Not only is it a time for you to relax, but plants and trees relax oxygen, or <i> clean air </i>, and suck up some of those carbon emmissions.</h1></li>
        <li><h1>Believe it or not, wasting food also adds to the pollution. When serving yourself for a meal, take only as much as you can handle, you can always take seconds! By not leaving food waste, you are doing your part in keeping the environment clean.</h1></li>
      </ol>
      </div>    </div>
    <div class ="homegallery">
      <h1 class="why">Plastic in the oceans is one of the leading causes of pollution. Watch this National Geographic video to see how humans can try to keep plastic out of the oceans and off of our streets.</h1>

      <div>
      <h1> Here are some more ways that your actions can cause positive change!</h1>
      <ol>
        <li><h1>When going on a hike or for a swim at the beach, don't leave your trash around the place. Just like we wouldn't want garbage in our living rooms at home, Mother Earth doesn't want plastic containers, bottle caps, or any other trash polluting her beautiful wonders.</h1></li>
        <li><h1>Beach cleanups are a fun and helpful voluteering activity! Get in touch with your local volunteering advisors to get credit or to set up a beach cleanup, to prevent all the trash going into the oceans.</h1></li>
        <li><h1>Try not to use straws! When you're at a restaurant or even just at home, before opening up the wrapper to that plastic straw, take a second thought. Do you really need another piece of plastic to help you drink? </h1></li>
