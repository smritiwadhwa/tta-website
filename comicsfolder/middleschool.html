        <div class="content">
        <h4> Book 1: Twelve-year-old Percy Jackson is on the most dangerous quest of his life. With the help of a satyr and a daughter of Athena, Percy must journey across the United States to catch a thief who has stolen the original weapon of mass destruction — Zeus’ master bolt. Along the way, he must face a host of mythological enemies determined to stop him. Most of all, he must come to terms with a father he has never known, and an Oracle that has warned him of betrayal by a friend.
        Book 2: When Thalia’s tree is mysteriously poisoned, the magical borders of Camp Half-Blood begin to fail. Now Percy and his friends have just days to find the only magic item powerful to save the camp before it is overrun by monsters. The catch: they must sail into the Sea of Monsters to find it. Along the way, Percy must stage a daring rescue operation to save his old friend Grover, and he learns a terrible secret about his own family, which makes him question whether being the son of Poseidon is an honor or a curse.
        Book 3: When Percy Jackson gets an urgent distress call from his friend Grover, he immediately prepares for battle. He knows he will need his powerful demigod allies at his side, his trusty bronze sword Riptide, and… a ride from his mom.
        The demigods rush to the rescue to find that Grover has made an important discovery: two powerful half-bloods whose parentage is unknown. But that’s not all that awaits them. The titan lord Kronos has devised his most treacherous plot yet, and the young heroes have just fallen prey.
        They’re not the only ones in danger. An ancient monster has arisen — one rumored to be so powerful it could destroy Olympus — and Artemis, the only goddess who might know how to track it, is missing. Now Percy and his friends, along with the Hunters of Artemis, have only a week to find the kidnapped goddess and solve the mystery of the monster she was hunting. Along the way, they must face their most dangerous challenge yet: the chilling prophecy of the titan’s curse.
        Book 4: Percy Jackson isn’t expecting freshman orientation to be any fun, but when a mysterious mortal acquaintance appears, pursued by demon cheerleaders, things quickly go from bad to worse.
        Time is running out for Percy. War between the gods and the Titans is drawing near. Even Camp Half-Blood isn’t safe, as Kronos’ army prepares to invade its once impenetrable borders. To stop them, Percy and his friends must set out on a quest through the Labyrinth — a sprawling underground world with surprises and danger at every turn.
        Along the way Percy will confront powerful enemies, find out the truth about the lost god Pan, and face the Titan lord Kronos’ most terrible secret. The final war begins… with the Battle of the Labyrinth.
        Book 5: All year the half-bloods have been preparing for battle against the Titans, knowing the odds of victory are grim. Kronos’s army is stronger than ever, and with every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil Titan’s power only grows.
        While the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now it’s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time. In this momentous final book in the New York Times best-selling Percy Jackson and the Olympians series, the long-awaited prophecy surrounding Percy’s sixteenth birthday unfolds. And as the battle for Western civilization rages on the streets of Manhattan, Percy faces a terrifying suspicion that he may be fighting against his own fate.

        <button type="button" class="collapsible"><h3> The Trials of Apollo +</h3></button>
        <div class="content">
          <h4> Book 1- The book opens with Apollo landing in a dumpster in an alley in New York City; in the form of a mortal teenager named Lester Papadopoulos because of the events leading up to the war between the Greeks and the Romans. After shenanigans happen, he meets Meg McCaffrey. Believing that he must only undertake a simple quest to regain his immortality, Apollo and Meg travel to Camp Half-Blood with the help of Percy Jackson, where they learn most of the world's Oracles have stopped working. The two undertake a quest to locate and protect a remaining oracle, also hoping to learn how to help the other oracles and regain Apollo's immortality. Apollo also finds out that the first oracle he has to save is heavily guarded by the mysterious 'Beast' who happens to be the first of the three evil Roman-emperors-turned-Gods, the Roman Emperor Nero.
          <br><br>
          Book 2- The book continues the story of Apollo as the mortal Lester, as he leaves the safety of Camp Half-Blood and journeys across North America to restore the remaining four Oracles and learn how to defeat the Triumvirate of Roman emperors-turned-Gods, while being helped by Leo Valdez, Calypso and Festus the bronze dragon, the Hunters of Artemis, and some new characters. Apollo has to face and defeat the second Triumvirate emperor- Commodus, with whom Apollo shares an awkward and regretful past to obtain the Throne of Memory for his next prophecy. Apollo travels to the Oracle's cave and gets his prophecy and comes back and defends himself and his friends from Commodus.
          <br><br>

          Book 3- The book follows Lester Papadopoulos/Apollo, Meg McCaffrey and Grover Underwood while they try to rescue Herophile, an Oracle that speaks only in puzzles, from the most infamous Roman emperor. After fleeing the labyrinth, Apollo dreams about the Oracle saying that he must save her even though it is a trap. When he wakes up, he finds himself in Grover's base. When Meg wakes up, they find the line from the prophecy, 'Demeter's daughter finds her ancient roots' to occur. Apollo and Grover go out to try to find Gleeson Hedge in an army store called Macro's Military Madness. They then find out that Macro, the store owner, is actually Naevius Sutorius Macro, working for Caligula. He attacks them with an army of automatons. By activating 'command sequence: Daedalus twenty three', they defeat Macro with his own robots. They then navigate the maze with enlisting the help of Piper McLean and Jason Grace. After a raid on Caligula's fleet of ships and Jason dying, Apollo and Meg steal a pair of Caligula's sandals, which let people navigate the Labyrinth. Piper, upset over Jason's death, is unable to help them anymore. The next day, Grover, Meg and Apollo, using Caligula's shoes, walk the Labyrinth. They free Herophile, discover a new prophecy and free Helios. Piper comes back and kills Medea, a sorceress who was working with Caligula (also Helios's grandchild). The book ends with Leo arriving from Camp Jupiter, learning about his friend's death, and Apollo and Meg going to San Francisco while Gleeson Hedge, Mellie and baby Chuck, Piper and her dad set off to Oklahoma, with a ride from Leo.
          <br><br>

          Book 4- The story is set at Camp Jupiter in the San Francisco Bay Area. The story starts off with Apollo and Meg taking Jason's body to Camp Jupiter. On their way to Camp Jupiter, they are attacked by eurynomos, but a girl with pink hair arrives with dryads and a faun and kills the Eurynomous. She then introduces herself as Lavinia and says she will take them to camp Jupiter. After that, all the dryads and fauns start to leave. But as the last faun, Don, tries to leave, Lavinia spots him and says that he will not leave because of what he is supposed to owe Lavinia for helping him. They carry Jason's tomb to the tunnel where she knows a shortcut to Camp Jupiter. Suddenly, Hazel as well as two more euronymous come. They enter the tunnel, while Hazel tries to kill the euronymous. Apollo tries to sing a song to help Hazel, but is scratched in the belly by a Eurynomous, before Hazel kills it. Due to him being scratched, Apollo starts to turn into a Corpse. Hazel sees Jason's coffin and is terrified because she had a dream about Jason being killed by Emperor Caligula. After that, the five carry Jason's tomb and arrive in Camp Jupiter where they are greeted by Frank Zhang and Reyna Ramirez-Arellano while everyone watches Jason's coffin being carried. Apollo sings a song about his quest and everyone is touched. They all decide that they will carry on with Jason's plan which was to build temples to honor the gods.  Apollo then faints and has a dream about Caligula and Commodus discussing their plan about either taking Camp Jupiter without conflict, or destroying it using Greek fire explosions by mortars on Caligula's yachts. Apollo finds himself in a bed where Meg explains that he had been asleep for about a day and a half. There is a funeral for Jason that night, where Lupa comes and tells Lester to get divine help to defeat their enemies. Apollo and Frank go to Ella and Tyson, who were busy recreating the Sibylline Books. They get a prophecy regarding Tarquin's tomb, as they found about it in the previous prophecy.They later go to the senator where they select him, Meg, Lavinia and Hazel to go to for a mission to find more about the final king of Rome, Tarquin, who has returned. After they find out about the old ghost King and his plans, they get more scared for the camp. They also find that Tarquin has kept the soundless god at Sutro Tower. After they return, they realize that to solve communication issues and get divine help, they need to destroy the soundless god. So a quest is issued for Apollo, Meg and Reyna to go to Sutro Tower. But that is in the evening of the next day, and most of the morning is spent on training. At the tower, they realize the god is Harpocrates, who had troubles with Apollo. He also has a jar containing the voice of the Sibyl of Cumae. With some difficulty, they manage to get the last breath of Harpocrates, along with Sibyl's Jar, which are required to get divine help. As they return, they are ambushed by an euronymous again, and after they manage to kill him, they are helped by Lavinia and her friends, who had escaped from the Camp earlier. Reyna and Lavinia issue "Plan L" to defeat the yachts that Apollo saw in his dream. After Apollo and Meg return, they see the camp in the midst of a war. Apollo calls for divine help on Temple Hill. He decides to call Diana. Frank (the other praetor of Rome) sacrifices himself holding his firewood killing Caligula along the way to save the other legionnaires. Apollo later kills Commodus in the grief of losing Frank. Commodus gives the order to fire. Due to Plan L, it fails and the yachts are destroyed. Meanwhile, Tarquin had reached the bookshop where the books where being re-written, but Ella and Tyson are not there. Meg and Hazel fight Tarquin. Diana finally arrives and kills Tarquin and heals Apollo just in time. Reyna and Lavinia, along with Peaches, return. Arion rescues Frank who mysteriously survives death and Reyna Ramirez-Arellano pledges herself to the goddess Diana (Artemis) and joins the Hunters. Dakota, son of Bacchus, passes away overnight due to wounds that he got in battle. He was the longtime Centurion of the Fifth Cohort. Don the faun also dies. He gets reincarnated into a laurel tree, Apollo's tree of victory. Hazel is voted as the new Praetor of Camp Jupiter and Lavinia voted as Centurion of the Fifth Cohort.  Apollo receives his old Godly Bow as a gift from Camp Jupiter, Meg receives seeds and they set off to New York after receiving the last and final prophecy from Ella and Tyson, which they realize is a terza rima, and they would have to find more stanzas in the East. They go in hopes to once again be reunited with their old friends from Camp Half-Blood.

          Book 5- While returning to New York, Apollo and Meg McCaffrey encounter an amphisbaena, which recites the second stanza of the Terza Rima prophecy. Within minutes, they are attacked by Nero's Gaul, Luguselwa, and her Germani. Apollo and Meg escape with the help of Luguselwa, who turns out to be good. The trio reach the Upper East side. They decide to go to Percy Jackson for help. They meet Percy's mother, Sally, his stepdad Paul Blofis, and his newborn baby sister Estelle. They learn that Percy and his girlfriend, Annabeth are in the West Coast. There they plan on defeating Nero, which involves them fighting against Lu in open daylight and Apollo pushing Lu off the building. All go according to plan. Then Apollo and Meg use The chariot of Damnation to reach Camp Half-Blood. The grey sisters recite the last couplet of the terza rima prophecy. Then they reach their destination. There it is found that Chiron had gone for a meeting with gods from other pantheons, including Bast from The Kane Chronicles, and Mimir from Magnus Chase and the Gods of Asgard .  After finally defeating Nero, Apollo faces off against Python for the final time. By knocking the monster into the Sea of Chaos, Apollo is able to destroy him forever. In the aftermath, having learned his lesson, Apollo is made into a god again and gets his throne back. With Python gone, Rachel regains her ability of prophecy and makes a prophecy that is noted to sound bad. While visiting Nico and Will Solace, Apollo learns that Nico has been hearing a voice calling for help from Tartarus, a voice that he believes belongs to Iapetus despite the Titan's apparent destruction in The House of Hades. Nico and Will intend to travel to Tartarus to find out what happened to Iapetus and rescue him if they can. - Google
